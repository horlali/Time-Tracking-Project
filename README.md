# SIMPLE TIME TRACKING PROGRAM

**A simple program to allow workers to keep records of their work**

### HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

The program allow workers to collect information about their customers.
The customer's information includes: customer name, customer contact, customer location.
The program also goes further to allow the worker to input the services to be performed.
**He also gets the chance to input the price he will charge for working on the project.**
The program uses the system date but allows the user to input the start time and end time.

After the program is executed and the user inputs all the required information the program displays the date the task that was executed, the total hours spent working on the task and most importantly the amount of money the user made from working on the task.

In order to keep track of the user's work history, all the information above is passed into a csv file containing 10 columns.


### IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

#### The Process
_DEFINING THE PROBLEM -----> ANALYSING THE REQUIREMENTS -----> WRITING THE PROGRAM -----> TESTING THE PROGRAM -----> MODIFYING THE PROGRAM -----> RE-TESTING THE PROGRAM_

#### Programming Language and Libraries
The program was written entirely in *Python*. We utilised the *datetime library* for handling the date and time. We also utilised the CSV module to write the information into the CSV file.
